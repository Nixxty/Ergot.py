# Ergot.py
A discord bot focused on remote control of the host PC

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you set your data (Guild ID, Channel ID, Bot Token) properly, or else the bot will NOT work (safety precaution to prevent other users from controlling your PC)

NOTE: Ergot.py handles EVERYTHING in this project. it runs the bot file and it checks for updates, etc. There is no need to run the Python files separately. TLDR ONLY RUN Ergot.py

as of version 1.0
cmds:
help  |  lists all of ergots commands.
ss  |  screenshots your monitor(s) and sends the screenshot to the channel.
killproc  |  kills specified process NAME | ex: brave.exe
clearterm  |  clears the ergot terminal then takes a screenshot.
stats  |  outputs your CPU, GPU, and RAM usage, aswell as pc runtime.
shutoff  |  shuts off your PC within 10 seconds with confirmation ofc.
getpns  |  gets all process names (pns for short) and outputs them.

SECOND NOTE: be sure to run DataCHOV (Data Checker/Overwriter) before running bot, this is where you will your bot token and few other things necessary to run the bot.
